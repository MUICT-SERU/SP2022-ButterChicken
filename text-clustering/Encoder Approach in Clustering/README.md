# Studies on various-Encoder Pre-trained Model

This repository dedicates to research and study in the field of encoding text using UniXcoder, a unified cross-modal pre-trained model for programming languages developed by Microsoft.

Which we plan to utilize the encoding feature in the clustering process.

This repository include the documentation on the related topic which slothPete7773 has been study, which are present in the other Markdown files
